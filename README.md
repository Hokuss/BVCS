## üöÄ Welcome to BVCS!

Tired of the complex incantations, the arcane ceremonies, and the bewildering array of options that modern ide's present? Do you yearn for a simpler time, when making thngs felt... intuitive?

BVCS is born from that yearning. It's not designed to manage the Linux kernel, nor to handle thousands of concurrent developers. It is just one guy going insane with the crazyness of new IDE's and deciding to build his own. 

**Can it dethrone Vim?** Probably not.

## ‚ú® Working Commands/Features

* In-Built version control system. 
* Large text editor is present with syntax highlighting feature. (Currently supports c/c++ syntax highlighting.)
* A simple 'Make' button that runs the commands you provide in the Options menu in sequence. 

## ‚ú® Future Features

* Optimizations: Enhance performance and storage efficiency as the project evolves.
* Community Input: Your comments and suggestions are welcome and will be considered for future development!

## üõ†Ô∏è How it (Conceptually) Works

The fire and forget mechanism is currently being built. Currently as it stands you need to buiild the project with opengl, glfw and ImGui (main and stdlb).
